# Evaluating Feature Imputation Strategies for Data Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
The purpose of this project is to evaluate feature imputation strategies for imputing data missing completely at random (MCAR). 

The evaluted strategies include: 
1. Mean imputation 
2. Median imputation
3. KNN imputation
4. Iterative imputation

Using simulated data, these imputation strategies were evaluated in terms of bias in an imputed feature's mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation with another target feature. To test the robustness of these results, the effects of various factors (e.g., proportion of missing data) on the performance of the imputation strategies were further examined, averaged over 25 simulations.
